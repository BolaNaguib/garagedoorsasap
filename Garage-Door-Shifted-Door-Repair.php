          			<h1> Most Common Reasons for Off-Track Doors</h1>
          			<p> The most common reason for garage door derailment is a faulty cable, one or both of the garage door cables is most probably broke or malfunctioning,
These cables assist in balancing the weight of the door and steer it during its cycle up and down the tracks. Garage door cables survive a long time if they are properly installed, so the primary reason for their damage is wear and tear.

          			<h1> Most Common Reasons for Off-Track Doors</h1>
          			<p> Occasionally your garage door may become loose from its tracks, because of a barrier, or from something knocking it-hard. As an example, if you had accidentally set your car into reverse when the garage door was still closed, the impact can cause the door to shift off its-tracks.
